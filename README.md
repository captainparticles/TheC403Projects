The C403 Projects.

Why Hello Thur!

I'll slowly start adding stuff here, for now theres a few utilities and a very,
very thin skeleton for shared concepts and libraries, as well as the BUTT.

The coding style used is a variation of Cutler Normal Form (CNF). Named after
Dave Cutler from Microsoft. I picked it up during my internships there and was 
converted to it. It's verbose, but clear and makes sense.
